# Tic-Tac-Toe Application

## Description

Created a simple react app to play tic tac toe.

### How to work on the project

-   Clone the Repository

-   Make changes
-   To run the app type `npm start` in your `console`
-   To build your app for production type `npm build` in your `console`

### Problems that might occur while commiting

I have configured a pre-commit check that checks your code against a standard.
If the code does not follow the standard you wont be able to commit your changes.

This helps in avoiding any non-standard practices of writing code, makes the code more readable.

In case you want to commit please run the command `npm run check` which will check the code quality and thell where is it mismatched.
The command to fix all the linting errors please run `npm run fix` which will re-write your code wit all the prettier style.
